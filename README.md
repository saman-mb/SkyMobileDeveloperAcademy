# Movie Trailers Mobile App Exercise

![](https://www.latestfreestuff.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Free-Sky-Movie-Worth-Â£13.99.png)

## Brief

We would like you to build movie video player app that presents movie information from an API in a list format and allows the user to select a fact to present more details to the user. The first screen will show a list of facts to the user. When selecting a fact a second screen is presented to the user showing more details about that fact. We also want to see some indication when the data is loading as well as messaging to handling any potential errors that may arise.

### Requirements

- The app should be written in Swift. You can use the latest tooling / swift version if you like, or something a little older it's not all that important.

- Please do not import external dependencies such a networking libraries, futures/promises libraries or reactive libraries. We are more interested to see how you approach solving the exercise using just the vanilla Apple SDKs.

- It is up to you to decide how the UI looks, what is important for this exercise is that all the ACs are met precisely and that the application works as per the requirements.
