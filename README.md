Sky would like you to build movie trailers app that presents information about movies from an API in a list and also allows users to select more details about a particular movie!

### Requirements

- The first screen will show a list of movies to the user
- The second screen will show the details about a particular movie to the user
- Tapping a movie from the list should present that movies details to the user
- On both screens the user should see a loading spinner when the screen is loading the data
- If the data fails to load for some reason the user should see an error message

#### Bonus Requirent!

Allow users to play the trailer for a movie from the programme details page.
- The user should see a play icon on top of the programmes image
- Tapping the play icon should begin playing the movies trailer
